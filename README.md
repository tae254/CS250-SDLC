How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by paying close attention to user stories and implementing features into a program the way the end user wants it to work. Creating user stories helps with this because I am able to visually see what the user is expecting to do and what the end user is expecting the outcome to be. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs in an incremental matter. I try to get a small working program and gradually start to add new features. One agile process that I hope to incorporate into my future developments is sprints. Since learning about sprints I have incorporated them into my personal projects. Having a backlog and trying to acheive as many as possible before the end of the sprint has been a game changer in my development process. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means being able to effeciently work with others on the team, being open, and being able to communicate with other team members. To be a good team member you also have to be able to take contstructive critism and allow yourself to grow with the team and not only as an individual.
